# Material Icons

A small application I created to quickly search, modify, and save icons provided by the [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/icons).
<br>

## Features

- On launching, you can view the complete list of material icons. Click on any of them to open a dialog box where you can specify the color and location for the specifed icon. This selects the icon, masks it with the chosen color, and saves it in the location specified.

- There is also a search bar, where you can quickly search for an icon by typing its name. A drop-down appears which shows first few matches found with the phrase you typed in. You can click on any of the items in this drop-down, and the same dialog box will appear which allows you to mask the icon with a color and save it the specified location.

- On the right hand side, is a sidebar which sets a few global properties:

  - The default color to be applied to the selected icon (in case, none is provided)
  - The project location, where icons will be saved (in case, none is provided in the dialog box)
  - The resource location, where additional icons are to be fetched.

- You can also import additional icons (in PNG, JPEG formats only) by clicking on the **SOURCE** button on the right side of the search bar. These icons can then be selected, colored, and saved just like the regular icons.

## Why I created this?

At that time, I did not have a very reliable internet connection (speed below 1Mbps) and found myself using material icons provided by Google Fonts repeatedly. Therefore, I created this application to quickly manipulate these icons.

## Installing

I am afraid, but I do not think this application is easily installable. The sole purpose of me creating this repository was to practice git and GitHub CLI commands.

However, if you have a suitable version of QT installed (QT 5+), you should be able to build this application from the QT Creator.

## Additional information

Feel free to view the source code, and use it (commercially too), modify it, or sell it. I do not mind anything. In case you want to improve the existing code, open a PR and let me know. Have a nice day !
